Use \"else\" when:\n   • The ego vehicle's action does not match any predefined category\n   • The scene is ambiguous or uncertain (confidence < 90%)\n   • No clearly identifiable maneuver occurs\n4. For \"else\" segments: Cover ONLY time periods with NO identifiable predefined maneuver\n5. Time segments MUST be contiguous and non-overlapping, covering the entire 20-second video\n6. Minimum segment duration: 1.0 second. Ignore shorter or transient actions\n7. Base times on video timeline (0.0 to 20.0 seconds)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n<driving_maneuver>action_label</driving_maneuver> from <start_time>XX.X</start_time> to <end_time>YY.Y</end_time> seconds\n• Use one of the predefined category labels or \"else\" for each time segment\n• Multiple segments: Separate with \" and \" in chronological order\n• Time precision: 1 decimal place (e.g., 5.0, 23.5)\n• NO additional text or explanations—only output the formatted segments\n\nCATEGORY DEFINITIONS:\n1. TrafficLight_StraightStopOrGo: Ego vehicle stops or starts at a traffic light for straight-line movement\n2.
